TUDelft blockchain lab, established 25 August 2007.

Goal: re-inventing money

Early pioneering work of the lab includes the 'bandwidth as a currency' work together with Harvard University, Internet-deployed in 2007. See BBC News coverage.

Another milestone for the lab was the cooperation with Wikipedia.org website, further expanding our "bandwidth as a currency" work. Within this partnership we deployed a browser plugin which enables users to donate bandwidth to the Wikipedia website.
